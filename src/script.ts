    { info: "üòÄThe getElementById() method returns an element with a specified value.The getElementById() method returns null if the element does not exist. The getElementById() method is one of the most common methods in the HTML DOM. It is used almost every time you want to read or edit an HTML element." },

    { info: "The reduce() method executes a user-supplied 'reducer' callback function on each element of the array, in order, passing in the return value from the calculation on the preceding element. The final result of running the reducer across all elements of the array is a single value." },
    { info: "The Array.from() static method creates a new, shallow-copied Array instance from an iterable or array-like object." },
    { info: "The Object.values() method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property values, in the same order as that provided by a for...in loop. (The only difference is that a for...in loop enumerates properties in the prototype chain as well.)" },

Neither static methods nor static properties can be called on instances of the class. Instead, they're called on the class itself." },
    { info: "Class fields are public by default, but private class members can be created by using a hash # prefix. The privacy encapsulation of these class features is enforced by JavaScript itself." },
    { info: "Encapsulation is the packing of data and functions into one component (for example, a class) and then controlling access to that component to make a 'blackbox' out of the object. Because of this, a user of that class only needs to know its interface (that is, the data and functions exposed outside the class), not the hidden implementation." },
    { info: "Inheritance enables you to define a class that takes all the functionality from a parent class and allows you to add more. Using class inheritance, a class can inherit all the methods and properties of another class. Inheritance is a useful feature that allows code reusability." },
    { info: "An object contains some properties and methods. We can hide them from the outer world through access modifiers. We can provide access only for required functions and properties to the other programs. This is the general procedure to implement abstraction in OOPS." },

Undefined variables are those that are declared in the program but have not been given any value. If the program tries to read the value of an undefined variable, an undefined value is returned." },
    { info: "Undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. On the other hand, null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value. Also, undefined and null are two distinct types: undefined is a type itself (undefined) while null is an object." },
